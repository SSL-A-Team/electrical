Kicker v1.0.0 Errata

DO NOT FABRICATE - major problems present

1. **Improper soldermask on high voltage capacitor footprint may cause arcing at high voltages**
2. **Improper clearance between switching FET and transformer may cause minor arcing when DVtrans reaches high end of cycle values**
3. RST and BOOT0 need control side pull resistors
4. Control side of isolator needs power jumper option, it's invalid for this side to be powered off
