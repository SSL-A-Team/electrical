# Errata for Control v1.1.0

 - Silkscreen version reads "v1.0.0" when it should read "v1.1.0"
 - U1 is damaged on battery connection. 
   - Root Cause: inductive EOS. 
   - Solution: bridge JP1, depopulate C3, C6, C7.
   - Patch Notes: slow shutdown does not work after mod
 - U1 UVLO/OVLO sometimes doesn't work.
   - Root Cause: inductive EOS.
   - Solution: bridge JP1, depopulate C3, C6, C7, depopulate R33
   - Patch Notes: slow shutdown does not work after mod, OVLO/UVLO bypassed
 - Robot ID Rotary Encoder doesn't work
   - Root Cause: Pull Ups/Downs on the higher half of GPIOG (PG8-PG15) don't seem to work. Root cause unclear.
   - Solution: use DIP switches for Robot ID
   - Patch Notes: 
 - Kicker detect doesn't work
   - Root Cause: Pull Ups/Downs on the higher half of GPIOG (PG8-PG15) don't seem to work. Root cause unclear.
   - Solution:
   - Patch Notes: feature unavailable
 - Radio UART flow control may not work
   - Root Cause: Pull Ups/Downs on the higher half of GPIOG (PG8-PG15) don't seem to work. Root cause unclear.
   - Solution:
   - Patch Notes: untested, feature unavailable
